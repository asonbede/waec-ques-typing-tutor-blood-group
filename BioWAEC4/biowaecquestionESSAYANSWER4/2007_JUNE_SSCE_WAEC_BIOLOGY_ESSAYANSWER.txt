    "1     (a) Differences between Tropic and Nastic movement:\n \u2014 Tropic movement is a growth movement while nastic movement does not lead to growth\n \u2014 Tropic movement is a  responds to unilateral stimulus while nastic movement is a respond to a diffuse stimulus\n \u2014 Tropic movement is slow response while nastic movement is a fast response\n \u2014 Tropic movement is not reversible while nastic movement is reversible\n \u2014 Tropic movement is not due to cell turgor while nastic movement is  due to changes in cell turgor\n \u2014 Tropic movement is a directional response while nastic movement is a non-directional response.\n(b) How light brings about tropic movement in stem and root of a flowering plant:\n \u2014 When unilateral lightfalls on the stem, the auxin/growth hormone/IAA, is displaced from the lighted to the dark side\n \u2014 The increase in auxin concentration on the dark side increases growth on that side causing the stem to bend towards the light/positive phototropism\n \u2014 in roots the auxin is displaced from the lighted side to the dark side\n \u2014 The increase in auxin concentration retards growth on the dark side causing the root to bend away from the light/negative phototropism.\n(c) The following would be observed when a growing  seedling is placed horizontally:\n \u2014 Shoot bends upwards, showing negative geotropism/positive phototropism\n \u2014 Root bends downwards, showing positive geotropism/negative phototropism.\n(d)Functions of the Pituitary gland:\n \u2014 Stimulates growth/growth of long bones/cell division\n \u2014 Stimulates production of sex-hormones/testosterone,estrogen\n \u2014 Stimulates production of anti-diuretic hormone/ADH/regulation of water reabsorption in the kidney/osmoregulation \n \u2014 Produces hormones which control other endocrine glands/stimulates thyroid gland/adrenal cortex\n \u2014 Stimulates protein synthesis\n \u2014 Induces birth by contraction of uterine muscles/production of ox\u00fdtoxin.\n \u2014 Induces milk secretion/produces prolactin\n \u2014 Controls egg and sperm production.\n(e) Differences between growth in plants and animals:\n \u2014 growth in plants can lead to movement(trophic movement) while growth in animals does not lead to movement\n \u2014 plants grows throughout their entire life while animals stops growing affer a certain period\n \u2014 growth in plant produces unlimited number of organs/parts while growth in animals produces a fixed number of organs(e.g two legs,two hands)\n \u2014 growth in plants is limited to specific regions while growth in animals is diffused/intercalary.
