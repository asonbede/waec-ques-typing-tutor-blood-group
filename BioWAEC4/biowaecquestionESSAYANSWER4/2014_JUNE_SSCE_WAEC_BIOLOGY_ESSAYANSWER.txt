Metabolic  wastes are poisonous if allowed to accumulate.\n    Respiration: This is the breakdown/burning of food substances; by aerobic/anaerobic respiration; to release energy needed for all processes of life.\n    Reproduction: This is the ability of living organisms to produce new individuals of their own kind; this ensures the continuity of the species of an organism.\n    Irritability: Response/reaction of organisms; towards changes in the environment; to ensure survival.\n    Nutrition: the process involved in obtaning/manufacturing food(can be autotrophic/heterotrophic) and utilizing it for growth and mainteance of 1ife processes.\n    Growth: This is the irreversible increase in size and weight of an organism whch leads to complexity and maturation.\n    Competition: Ability of organisms to struggle; for all necessity of life; to survive in their environment.\n    Adaptation: Ability of organisms to adjust; to changes in environment for survival.\n    Life span/death All living organisms have definite period of existence; all organisms die.\n (b) differences between plants and animals:\n - Animals move from place to place with their whole body/locomotion while plants are fixed/do not move from place to place and can only move part of their body e.g leaves/stem/root\n - Animals depend on already made food/heterotrophic mode of nutrition while plants plants manufacture their own food using energy from the sun and simple organic substances\n - Chlorophll/chloroplast is absent in animal cells but present in plant cells.\n - Cell cellulose wall is  in absent in animal cells while cellulose cell wall is  present in plant cells.\n - Sense organs are present in animals but absent in plants.\n - Growth is both limited/definite and proportional in animals while growth is both unlimited/indefinite and apical in plants.\n - Animals store carbohydrates as gycogen while plants store carbohydrates as starch.                     \n - Animals exhibits fast response to stimulus while plants show slow response to stimulus.\n - Animals have respiratory organs while plants lack respiratory organs\n (c)(i) Name of organism: Euglena/Chlamydomonas.\n (ii) Animal features: For Euglena\n \u2014 Gullet for feeding.\n \u2014 Has flagellum for locomotion in water.\n \u2014 Myonemes for movement.\n \u2014 Has pellicle that gives it a definite shape.\n \u2014 Has eye spot to detect light intensity.\n \u2014 Has contractile vacuole for osmoregulation and excretion.\n Plant features:\n - Definite shape.\n \u2014 Has chloroplast containing chlorophyll used to absorb light.\n \u2014 Paramylum granules.\n \u2014 Pyrenoid.

    "2     (a) Definition of terms: (i) Elimination: Removal of undigested food from the body of living organisms\n(ii) Excretion: Removal of waste products of metabolism; from the cells/tissues of an organism may be toxic if retained in the body\n(iii) Secretion: Production and release of substances useful to the body by specialized glands of living organism\n(b) Digestion of boiled fish in the gut of humans: Boiled fish is a source of protein; chewed and swallowed \u00ecnto the stomach;\n digestion of protein starts from the stomach; stomach secrets gastric juice; containing pepsin, rennin and hydrochloric acid; pepsin in acidic medium\nacts on the boiled fish and convert it to peptides; peptides move into the duodenum/small intestine; into\nwhich pancreatic juice is secreted; undigested protein is acted upon by trypsin in alkaline medium; into\npeptides/Peptides; erepsin finally acts on peptides/Peptones in alkaline medium; and converts it into amino acids\n(c) Diagram of villus.   2014WAECESSAY5.jpg",
    "3     (a)(i) Biosphere: part of the earth where life exists.\n (ii) Habitat: A place/home within an environment where an organism naturally lives/dwells.\n (b) Mode of nutrition of named carnivorous plants:\n - Carnivorous plants have green leaves and are able to manufacture their own food from photosynthesis.\n \u2014 They have roots to absorb water and mineral salts from the soil.\n \u2014 Usually grow in places with little nitrogenous salts.\n \u2014 Use insects/other small animals as source of Nitrogen.\n \u2014 They have devices/modified leaves with bright colour/sents/sugary liquids/sticky wet surfaces for attracting and trapping insects.\n \u2014 Once the insects is trapped, the plant secretes enzymes to kill and digest it.\n \u2014 The soluble nitrogenous compounds are absorbed/assimilated by the plant.\n   Name of carnivourous planta:\n - Butterwort/Pinquicula - BladderWort/Utricularia - Sundew/Drosera - Venus fly-trap/Diofnaea \u2014 Pitcher plants/Nepenthes/Sarrancenta.\n(c) Importance of fruits and seed dispersal:\n - Prevents overcrowding of plants.\n - Prevents undesirable competition for space/light/water and nutrients.\n \u2014 Prevents diseases from spreading among plant species.\n \u2014 Results in colonization of new areas with new plants.\n \u2014 Results in adaptation to adverse/harsh/unsuitable environment.\n(d) Soil conservation methods:\n - Contour ploughing/ridges are made along the contour of a slopping land/to prevent water running down the hill/slope/and washing away soil.\n \u2014 Strip cultivation/the land is divided into strips along the contours of the slopes/crops are planted in rows that alternate with the strips planted with cover crops/grasses.\n - Terracing/constriction of terraces which create barriers to hinder rapid water flow down the slope.\n \u2014 Mulching/materials left after weeding or harvest are left to lie on the soil/protecting the soil against agents of erosion.\n \u2014 Afforestation/cover cropping/growing grasses trees and shrubs to cover and protect the soil.\n \u2014 Crop rotation/growing crops on a piece of land in sequence/season after season to maintain its fertility.\n \u2014 Storm drains/construction of barriers/to stop free-flow of surface water through farms.\n \u2014 Application of manure/fertilizer/to stabilize the soil.\n \u2014 Avoid bush burning.\n \u2014 Avoid over grazing.
