    "1     (a) Importance of effective transport systems in mammals are as follows:\n \u2014 The primary purpose of transport systems is to move materials throughout the body of the organism; mammals have various substances/materials for specific\n functions located in different parts/organs of the body; for example oxygen is present in the lung while digested food is\n located in the alimentary canal; through transport systems metabolic waste products/excretory products are\n eliminated/removed via the kidney/lung/skin; Hormones which are produced by the endocrine glands are made\n available to far away cells which they serve; blood is the main medium of transport; assisted by the lymphatic\n system/lymph; Mammals being large and complex organisms have a surface area comparatively smaller than the\n volume/surface volume ratio is low; diffusion alone is inefficient; therefore there is the need to develop an efficient\n transport system to cope with this problem.\n (b) Functions of blood in mammals:\n \u2014 Blood  transport digested food from the small intestines where they are produced as end-products of digestion to various parts of the body where they are stored/assimilated or used\n \u2014 It transports soluble excretory waste materials such as Urea/C02/to organs of excretion such as kidney/lungs\n \u2014 Facilitates transport of hormones from the glands where they are produced to target organs\n \u2014 Distribution of excess heat from deeply seated organs to maintain a constant body temperature is equally a function of the blood\n \u2014 Transport of oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body/transport of carbon dioxide produced by the tissues to the lungs\n \u2014 Defence against disease/foreign bodies through photocytosis\n \u2014 When an injury occurs, clotting of blood (by platelets/thrombocytes and fibrinogen) prevents excess loss of blood, and also prevents entry of parnogens/germs\n \u2014 immunity is achieved by antibodies and lymphocytes carried by blood.\n(c) The following are materials transported in the bodies of flowering plants:\n \u2014 Latex/secretion/specific secretion\n \u2014 Water/soil water\n \u2014 Manufactured food e g. glucose, amino acids\n \u2014 Hormones/auxins\n \u2014 Dissolved mineral salts e.g. nitrated, phosphate\n \u2014 Oxygen\n \u2014 Carbon dioxide\n \u2014 Excretory products.

    "2     (a) Functions of the mammalian skeleton include:\n > provides posture and support to the body \u2014 backbones/vertebrae/pelvic girdle\n > It gives protection \u2014 ribcage protects heart and lungs, cranium(skull) protects brain,vertebrae protects spinal cord,pelvic girdle protects female reproductive organs\n > The skeleton helps in the production of blood cells \u2014 in the bone/marrow of the long bones\n > Storage of calcium \u2014 in the bone matrix\n > Movement/locomotion is enhanced \u2014 any of the limb bones\n > Breathing movements is made possible \u2014 by the ribs\n > Provides surface for the attachment of muscles  \u2014  tendons attach muscle to bones.\n (b) Bones and muscles bring about movement at the elbow in the following ways:\n  \u2014 Bicep and tricep act antagonistically to bring about movement at the elbow; the bicep is attached to the scapula and radius; while the tricep\n    are attached to the scapula and ulna; bicep contracts while tricep relaxes to cause bending/flexing of the forearm;\n    tricep contracts while bicep relaxes to cause straightening of the forearm.\n(c) Support in herbaceous and woody Plants can come in different ways:\n(i) Herbaceous Plant:\n \u2014 By turgidity, due to the presence of water, vacuoles inside parenchyma cells/living cells\n \u2014 Thickening of walls of collenchyma cell (at the corners)\n (ii) Woody Plant:\n \u2014 Sclerenchyma in the cortex\n \u2014 By the Xylem strengthened by deposits of lignin in their walls\n \u2014 Secondary growth/thickening provides extensive wood /secondary xylem and bark.\n(d) The vitamins and minerals element necessary for healthy bone development are:\n \u2014 Vitamin D/Calciferol\n \u2014 Vitamin C (forms the cement of bow)\n  Mineral elements:\n \u2014 calcium/phosphorus/magneSium.

    "3     (a) Definition of enzymes:\n \u2014 Enzymes are organic catalyst/substance that speed up/slow down the rate of biochemical reactions, they are made of proteins, and produced by living cells.\n(b) Characteristics of enzymes are:\n \u2014 Remain chemically unchanged at the end of a reaction\n \u2014 Are specific in action/one or a group of enzymes will act on specific substrates\n \u2014 Required in small quantities\n \u2014 Act best over a specific range of temperature/between 35oC\u2014 40oC\n \u2014 They are denatured/destroyed at nigh temperature/inactivated at very low temperature\n \u2014 Act best at specific pH\n \u2014 Their action is reversible\n \u2014 Enzyme action is retarded by poison or inhibitors\n \u2014 Some are inactive and require a co-enzyme/agent to activate them\n \u2014 They can function outside the body of the organism that produces them\n \u2014  Enzymes are protein in nature.\n(c) Role of Pancreatic juice in carbohydrate and Protein digestion are:\n \u2014 Pancreatic juice provides an alkaline  medium for the action of the enzymes involved; which operate in the small intestine/duodenum; pancreatic juice\n   contains Amylase/Amylopsin which converts starch to maltose sugar, it also contains trypsin which converts proteins\n   to peptone/peptide/polypeptides /amino acids; carboxypeptidase converts polypeptides to amino acids.\n(d) Storage of excess carbohydrate takes this form:\n (i) In Animals :\n \u2014 Glycogen /fat \n \u2014 In plants: Starch /Sucrose/Sugar.\n(e) The saprophytic nutrition in of Rhizopus goes like this:\n \u2014 Rhizopus grows on organic matter such as  damp/moist food/bread / decaying matter substrate;\n   its hyphae penetrate the food/substrate and secrete hydrolyzing enzymes which digest the food/substrate in extracellular digestion;\n   the hyphae absorb the digested food/soluble products for metabolic activity.
