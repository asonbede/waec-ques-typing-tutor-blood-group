    "2     (a) Why an athlete in a race should be given glucose drink rather than a piece of bread:\n \u2014 Glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrates/soluble form of carbohydrate; an energy-giving food substance; which does not require any form of digestion;\n   hence it is absorbed in the ileum/small intestine where it diffuses/enters into the blood stream/circulatory system; it is then assimilated and oxidized;\n   within the shortest time/quickly/immediately; to give energy to the athlete; bread is a complex carbohydrate/polysaccharide/starch;\n   which will require a series of digestive processes/hydrolysis; which starts in the mouth; and ends in small intestine/ileum;\n   this takes a longer time to produce energy for use/cannot give immediate energy. \n (b) Test for starch:\n \u2014 Macerate/crush a piece of the food substance\n \u2014 add water to the crushed food to form a solution/suspension/take a piece of food substance\n \u2014 put a few drops of the solution/suspension/piece of food on a white tile/watch glass/in test tube\n \u2014 add one or two drops of iodine solution\n \u2014 the solution/piece of food will turn blue black\n \u2014 indicating the presence of starch.\n(c) Importance of water in human diet:\n \u2014 Water is an essential part of living protoplasm; blood\n \u2014 it acts as a solvent; and transport medium in the body for food substances/gases/hormones\n \u2014 transports waste excretory products\n \u2014 it is a medium for chemical reactions/digestive processes\n \u2014 it function in distribution of body heat\n \u2014 it is the main component of the synovial fluid of joints and amniotic fluid\n \u2014 plays a protective function in the brain\n \u2014 allows easy movement of food through the digestive tract.

    "3   (a) Food chain:\n \u2014 This is a linear feeding relationship; in which energy is transferred from producer/plants; through a\n   series of organisms/trophic levels; in which each organism feeds on the preceding one; and provides food for the\n   succeeding one in the habitat.\n (b) A Terrestrial food chain:\n    Grass \u2014> Grasshopper \u2014> Lizard \u2014> Cat \u2014> Man. \n(c)(i) Flow of energy in he above food chain:\n  Energy flow is unindirectional/non-cyclic; it is either utilized;or stored; Light energy from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll in green plants/producers(the grass);\n  and used in photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates; the chemical energy in the carbohydrate is passed down the food chain; when the primary consumers(grasshopper)\n  feed on the plants/producer; the chemical energy is passed along the food chain to the secondary consumer(lizard); and then to the\n  tertiary consumer/decomposer(man).\n(ii) Energy loss in food chain:\n \u2014 Energy is lost at each tropic level; when a herbivore/primary consumer feeds on a plant/producer;\n   not all parts of the plant is eaten; as a result not all the energy in the plant/producer is consumed;\n   plants lose energy via respiration;each trophic do not utilize all the energy present in preceding members;\n   energy is also lost in respiration; excretion, movement; and other metabolic activities.
