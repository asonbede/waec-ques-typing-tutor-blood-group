    "3     (a) Short notes:\n (i) Niche: Refers to a specific portion of a habitat/dwelling place which is occupied by a particular\n species of organism. It is also a functional position/role of an organism within the community. Each organism living\n in the same habitat has its own living space, source of food and tolerance for the effect of the habitat/environment.\n (ii) Population density: It is the number of individual organisms of the same species per unit area/volume of the\n habitat at a particular time. It determines the interaction between members of the same species and members of\n other species. It is mathematically expressed as Total population size/Area of habitat. It is estimated in humans/animals by counting.In plants by using quadrat. \n (iii) Climax community: Is established when a stable/unchanging community is attained in ecological succession. The community is in\n  equilibrium with the environment. The vegetation reaches its highest development.\n  The same species of animals, plants/organism\n  re-occur from ,year to year.\n (b) Interaction between biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem:\n  In an ecosystem the abiotic factors are non-living things (carbondioxide,oxygen, sunlight, soil and water, etc)\n  while the biotic components are plants and animals.Green plants use carbondioxide in the presence of sunlight to produce carbonhydrate/\n  starch/food. Animals/herbivores feed on carbonhydrate/plants and release carbondioxide from respiration.Decomposers break down dead plants/animals/organic\n  matters to release nutrients to the soil. These nutrients are absorbed by plants for use in food production/photosynthesis. Plants give out oxygen during\n  photosynthesis, which is used by animals for respiration.                    ",

    "5     (a)(i) Placentation: This is the arrangement of ovules, within the ovary.\n(ii) Organs Associated with human placenta: Umbilical cord, Uterus\n (b) Functions of Placenta:\n \u2014 Establishes connection between the embryo and the mother.\n \u2014 Carries oxygen/water/food/nutrients from mother\u2019s blood to foetus.\n \u2014 Removes waste/urea/salt/carbon dioxide from foetus blood to mother\u2019s blood for elimination.\n \u2014 Produces progesterone/hormone for maintenance of uterine wall/endometrium/pregnancy.\n \u2014 Carries antibodies from mother\u2019s blood to foetus.\n(c) Viviparity: This is a type of reproduction in which the young develops inside the mother\u2019s body, obtaining nutrients directly from the parent.\n    When fully developed, the young are born alive.\n(ii) Territoriality: In many animal species individuals, usually males mark out areas/territories where they can live and breed. They guard these\n     territories fiercely. Chasing away other members of the species. Only vigorous individuals are able to establish large territories,\n     secure suitable mates and produce offsprings. Territoriality limits overcrowding. Animals that carry out this phenomenon are lizards, lions, etc.\n(iii) Seasonal migration: In many habitats food supply is affected by seasonal changes. Food is abundant in rainy seasons but scarce in dry seasons.\n      Animals overcome these seasonal food shortages by moving to other habitats during unfavourable seasons.\n      Such large scale seasonal movements of animals between habitats are called migrations.\n      Other causes of migrations are temperature changes and breeding seasons.
