    "1     (a)(i) Classification of Living things is the arranging of living things in groups according to those characteristics they have in common.\n(ii) The Binomial system of classification was developed by Carolus Linnaeus \n(iii) it is necessary to classify living things for the following reasons:\n1. For easy identification of similar orgaisms\n2. to put every iving organism into a systematic order;\n3. to indicate/show the relationships between different categories of living organisms\n4. to show evotutionary trends in different groups of living organisms:\n5. to trace geographical distribution of living organisms;\n6. for easy reference\n7. for easy research/study.\n(iv) The major groups into which taxonomist classify living things in order of hierachy are:\nKingdom -> Phylum/Division -> Cass -> Order -> Family -> Genus -> Species.\n1 (b) (i) Features which viruses have in common with living things are:\n1. possession of DNA(Deoxyribonucleic Acid) and RNA (Ribonucleic) Acid\n2. ability to reproduce/replicate\n3. possession of protein coat\n1 (b) (ii) Features which viruses have in common with non-living things are:\n1. lack of cell organelles,lack of locomotory,respiratory and reproductive abilities\n2. appear as crystals\n1 (C) (i) Viral diseases of Plants are: cassava mosaic disease; bean mosaic diseases, cacao swollen shoot disease; groundnut rosette; maize streak; cucumber mosaic.\n1 (C) (ii) Viral diseases of Humans are:\n    poliomyelitis/polio; chicken pox, mumps; measles;\n    influenza/flu; AIDS;\n    Ebola disease; infective hepatitis;\n    Lassa fever; Av\u00edan influenza (Bind flu) Swine flu (Bovineflu); Rabies; Zika; any correctly named disease.",
    "2     (a) Characteristic of Enzymes: \n- They are biological catalysts which promotes/facilitate/enhance//speed up the rate of biological reactions;\n- remain chemically unchanged at the end of a reaction;\n- their actions are reversible;\n- they are specific in action/act on specific substrates\n- enzymes are required in small amount\n- are protein in nature\n- they act best at optimum temperature\n- specific/sensitive to pH;\n- actions retarded or terminated by inhibitors;\n- some required co-enzymes to function.\n2 (b)i. Digestive enzymes produced in the duodenum of humans:\n- Amylase;\n- Trypsin/chymotrypsin;\n- Lipase\nii. Substrates for each enzyme\n- Amylase acts on starch\n- Trypsin/chymotrypsin acts on  protein\n- Lipase acts on fats and oil\niii. Product of enzyme activity\n-Amylase yields maltose\n-Trypsin/chymotrypsin yields peptones/polypeptide\n-Lipase yields glycerol and fatty acid\n2 (c)i.  chlorophyll is important to plants because it Absorbs sunlight used by plants for photosynthesis\n     ii. Macro-elements required for the formation of chlorophyll are Nitrogen; Magnesium; Iron\n     iii. Deficiency symptoms of each macro-elerne-:\n     Nitrogen\n    -Chlorosis/yellowing of leaves\n    - Stunted growth;\n    - Poor flower/fruit development\n     Magnesium\n    - Poor growth\n    - Chlorosis/yellowing of leaves\n    Iron \n    - Poor/stunted growth\n    - Chlorosis/yellowing of leaves\n2 (d) Procedure for test for starch:\n-> Detach the leaf to be tested from plant after 4 to 6 hours of exposure to sun to enable it to  form starch;\n-> Put leaf in boiling water for about 30 seconds to kill the cells;\n-> Put boiled leaf in 70% warm alcohol/ethylated spirit in water bath to decolorise the leaf\n-> Rinse decolorised/brittle leaf in running cold water to soften the leaf tissues/remove alcohol\n-> Spread out on white tiles/watch glass and add a few drops of iodine solution\n-> Allow to stand for a few minutes;\n-> It turns blue-balck showing/indicating presence of starch.",

    "6    (a) A brief explanation of the process of perceiving smell in humans\n-> chemical substances/dour carried in the air pas through the air/nasal cavity\n-> the molecules dissolve in the moist membrane of the nasal cavity\n-> sensory cells are stimulated\n-> impulses are formed  which pass through the nerves ending to the olfactory nerves\n-> which pass into the cerebrum of the brain/brain;\n-> the brain interprets the impulses;\n-> and the sensation of smell is smell is perceived\n(b) Adaptive features of the egg of a domestic fowl\n-> Porous shell; for gaseous exchange/provides shelter/ protects the embryo against mechanical damage!desiccation;\n-> Shell membranes; allow gaseous exchange/for protection   \n-> Yolk; contains high level of proteins and fats/provides food for embryonic growth;\n-> Egg white/albumen; consists of water to absorb shock!proteins/food; \n-> Air space; provides surface for gaseous exchange\n-> Chalaza; holds the yolk/embryo in position\n(c)i Autotrophs are Organisms that do not rely on other organisms for food,they manufacture their own food from using simple inorganic compounds\ncan be chemosynthetic or photosynthetic\nii Examples of unicellular autotrophs \n-> Chlamydomonas;\n-> Euglena;\n-> chemosynthetic bacteria\n-> sulphur bacteria;\n-> blue-green algae/Anabaena;\n-> Nostoc/\n-> Oscillatoria;\n-> Chlorella diatoms;\n-> Nitrosomonas;\n-> Nitrobacteria\n(d) Functions of WHO:\n-> provides grants for medical research\n-> improves public health/promotes environmental health\n-> prevents the spread of diseases vaccination\n-> provides vaccines/drugs in cases of emergences;\n-> informs/creates awareness/educates the public of any research findings/outbreak of diseases;\n- assists by sending medical personnel/logistical support to countries upon request;\n- Helps in the training of medical personnel\n- keeps health statistics\n- promotes nutritional/sanitary products\n(e) Examples of plants and animals that live in fresh water pond\n-> Plants: Water arum; diatoms; Ceratophyllum/hornwort;utricularia/bladderwort\nArrowhead/sedge; Pistia; Salvinia/water fern; water lily;\nwolffia/duckweed \n-> Animals: Cyclops; Daphn\u00eda/water flea; Hippopotamus;\ncrocodile; water snake; tadpoles; pond skaters;\nzooplanktons; mosquito larvae; water bugs; water\nscorpions; leeches; water snails; catfish/tilapis fishes\n(f) Differences between skin of a mammal and epidermis of leaf.\n(g) Types of competition on\n(i)A: Intraspecific competition\n(ii)B: Interspecific competition    2017WAECESSAY7.jpg"
