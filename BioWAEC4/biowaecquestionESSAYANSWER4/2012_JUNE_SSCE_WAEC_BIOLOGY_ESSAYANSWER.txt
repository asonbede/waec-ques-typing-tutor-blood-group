    "2     (a) Role of the stomach in digestion:\n \u2014 The stomach receives food when the sphincter at the entrance of the stomach relaxes.\n   The muscular walls of the stomach contract and relax, to churn/mix the food, and further break down the food\n   particles mechanically. The stomach produces gastric juices, which contain dilute hydrochloric acid,pepsin and rennin.\n   The dilute hydrochloric acid neutralizes the action of the salivary amylase and kills bacteria present in the food.\n   It creates a suitable pH for the action of pepsin, and activates inactive pepsinogen to form pepsin. The pepsin breaks\n   down the protein to polypeptide/peptides, while the rennin coagulates/curdles milk to enhance digestion by pepsin.\n   The mucus produced by the stomach wall lines the wall of the stomach to prevent the action of the acid on the\n   stomach wall, the mucus also lubricates the movement of the food in the alimentary canal.\n(b)(i) Parts of plants where food is stored:\n   \u2014 Leaves.\n   \u2014 Stems.\n   \u2014 Roots.\n   \u2014 Seed.\n   \u2014 Fruits.\n (ii) Examples:\n   \u2014 Leaves: Onions,shallot, garlic.\n   \u2014 Stems: Yam, sugarcane, ginger, Irish potatoes.\n   \u2014 Roots: Cassava, carrots, sweet potatoes.\n   \u2014 Seed: Groundnut, beans, coconut, cashew.\n   \u2014 Fruits: Maize, guava, orange, pawpaw, cashew, palm nut, mango. \n(c) Sugar regulation in mammals:\n   \u2014 The liver controls the blood glucose levels. It converts excess glucose in the blood to\n     glycogen. The process is stimulated by the hormone insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas. When the blood\n     glucose level falls below normal, the pancreas secretesn glucagons. This stimulates the conversion of glycogen into\n     glucose, which is released into the blood.                   ",
