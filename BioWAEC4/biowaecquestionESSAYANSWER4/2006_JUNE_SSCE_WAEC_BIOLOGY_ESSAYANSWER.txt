    "4     (a)  Hormone:\n \u2014 A hormone can be defined as a chemical substance produced in small quantities by endocrine/ductless glands\n   and carried to all other parts of the body/target organs by blood stream/vascular system, where it produces/exerts a\n   response.\n (b) Role of adrenaline in an emergency situation:\n \u2014  Any emergency experienced by an animal usually causes a sudden rage/fear/fright;\n \u2014  This leads to the release of adrenalin into the blood;\n \u2014  which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and consequently many different organs;\n \u2014  The rate of heart beat is increased and there is heavy breathing \n \u2014  similarly, there is increase in the body blood sugar/conversion of liver glycogen into glucose\n \u2014  The muscular tone/power is increased/ the pupils of the eyes dilate and the visceral muscles are affected\n \u2014  the animal reacts quickly and energetically.\n(c) Differences between hormonal co-ordination and nervous co-ordination:\n \u2014 Hormonal co-ordination involves transmission of chemical substances in the blood stream while and nervous co-ordination involves trasmission of\n    electrical and electrical impulses and chemical substances by nerve fibres\n \u2014 Response to stimulus by hormonal co-ordination is slow while response to stimulus by nervous co-ordination is fast\n \u2014 Hormonal co-ordination  is by hormones carried to the target organ via blood while nervous co-ordination is via neurons\n \u2014 Hormonal co-ordination  occurs in both plants and animals while nervous co-ordination occurs in only plants\n \u2014 Hormonal co-ordination  is involuntary while nervous co-ordination is both voluntary and involuntary\n \u2014 Responses to  hormonal co-ordination may last for a long time while responses to  nervous co-ordination are short-lived\n \u2014 The target organ of hormonal co-ordination  is usually far away from the site of hormone production while the target organ of nervous co-ordination may be near or far.\n(d)(i) Animal Hormones:\n \u2014 Somatotropic hormone\n \u2014 Prolactin\n \u2014 Gonatotropic\n \u2014 Thyroxine\n \u2014 Oxytocine\n \u2014 Anti-diuretic hormone/ADH\n \u2014 Parathormone \n \u2014 Adrenalin\n \u2014 Insulin\n \u2014 Oestrogen\n \u2014 Progesterone\n \u2014 Testosterone\n \u2014 Androsterone \n(ii) Plant Hormones:\n \u2014 1AA/indole-3-Acetic Acid/Auxin\n \u2014 2-4D/2-4 Dichlorophenoxy \u2014 acetic acid(Gibberellins)\n \u2014 Cydtokinins/kinins\n \u2014 Abscisie/Absisic acid,\n \u2014 Benzoic acid\n \u2014 NAA/Naphthalene acetic acid\n \u2014 IBA/Indolebutryric acid \n \u2014 Ethelene\n \u2014 Vernalin                     ",
