    "3     (a)(i) What is a Habitat? \n - The natural dwelling place of an organism or A place/locality where an organism lives successfully. \n (ii) Roles of a Decomposer in an Ecosystem: \n - Decomposers are organisms which bring about the decay of dead parts/whole of plants/animals to produce manure/humus;\n - they release nutrients in them into the soil; which are absorbed by roots of plants; and are used to build up new plant tissues; \n - they thus help in nutrient recycling; \n - also release offensive gases/odour pollute the air.\n(b) Energy Flow in a Freshwater Habitat: \n - Common aquatic Plants/Pista/Spirogyra/ using energy from the sun photosynthesize to produce food \n - the food is eaten by primary consumers animals\n - small aquatic animals would be eaten by bigger aquatic animals/secondary consumers \n - tertiary consumer a much bigger fish/riy correctly named fish will feed on secondary consumer;\n - in the process of feeding energy flows from one tropic level to another decreases progressively\n - dead animals/plants decompose; energy is lost. \n (c)(i) Harmful Effects of Microorganism to Plants: \n - They cause diseases; \n - They can cause undesirable qualities in plants/plant products; \n - They cause spoilage; \n - They lead to wastage; \n - Reduction in yield. \n (c)(ii) Beneficial Effects of Microorganisms to Humans; \n - Bacteria/decomposers help to decay/decompose dead organisms to release nutrients; \n - Bacteria is used in cleaning/moping up oil spillage; \n - Used in the fermentation of food/cocoa/beans/garri/locust beans/kenkey production;\n - Used to make vinegar; \n - Used in making alcohol beverages/wine/beer/spirit;\n - Used in making some antibiotics/pencilin; \n - Used in the manufacturer of insulin;\n - Used in making cheese/yoghurt/bread/single cell proteins; \n - Used in making flax! tanning of leather;\n - Production of some vitamins;\n - Sewage treatment.

    "4    (a)(i) Agglutination:\n - The clumping together of antigens of red blood cells with the corresponding antibodies in the plasma due to incompatible donor/recipient blood groups\n during blood transfusion\n (ii) Donor/recepient blood transfusion compatibility/incompatibility table. \n (b) How each of the following Organisms are Adapted for Obtaining Food: \n (i) Mosquito larva:\n -Posses a pair of ciliated mouth brushes: for creating water current to carry water with food particle into the mouth,\n  the mouth brushes also filter food out of water and sweep it into the mouth; \n (ii) Dodder Plant: \n - Posses haustoria; for penetrating host plant tissue to obtain food/water\n (iii)Grasshopper: \n -Posses mandibles heavy toothed jaw-like structures; for cutting/crushing food/plant materials! vegetation; \n -Possess maxillae; for directing food to mandibles/cutting/grinding food; \n -Labrum; for holding food/plant materials/vegetation;\n -Labium; for guiding foods/prevent it from falling off   2016WAECESSAY6.jpg",
    "6     (a)Differences between Tactic and Nastic Mov\u00e9menft in Plants:\n - Tactic movement involves movement of the  whole plant while in nastic movement only part of a plant moves;\n - Movement is directly towards or away from stimulus in tactic movement while movement is  non-directional nastic\n - Tactic movement is stimulated by light/heat/chemical while nastic movement is stimulated by   touch/tugor pressure\n(b) Examples of Organism that show:\n(i) Tactic Movement:\n - Volvox; Chiamydomonas; Euglena; earthworm; tilapia\n(ii) Nastic Movement:\n - Morning glory; Mimosa; Pride of Narbados(Caesalpnia);four O-clock plant,sunflower;Desmodium;Clover\n(c)(i) Ways of Caring for the Mammalian Skin:\n - Eating balanced diet rich in vitamins A/B2/E;\n - Engaging in regular exercise;\n - Washing the skin with clean water and soap daily;\n - Drinking lots of water;\n - moisturizing/rubbing the skin with lotion/cream;\n - Avoiding excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays/radiation;\n - Avoiding bleaching creams/harsh chemicals;\n - Wearing clean clothes next to skin;\n - Protect the skin against injury.\n(c)(ii) Stimuli to which the mammalian skin is sensitive are:\n - Touch;\n - Pressure;\n - Heat;\n - Cold;\n - Pain;\n - chemical.\n(d) Effects of High Temperature On Terrestrial Habitat:\n - Causes high transpiration rate in plants;\n - Plants wither/wilt;\n - Leads to high rate of metabolism in both plants and animals;\n - There is a high rate of decay of organic matter;\n - Leads to high rate of growth; and shorter length of life cycle in toad/housefly;\n - Makes poikilothermic animals to look for shelter from heat/hibernation/aestivation\n - There is high rate of water loss in animals/sweating/perspiration;\n - leads to high incidence of bush fires;\n - Migration/emigration may occur\n(e)(i) What is Courtship behavior in Animals?\n - A type of behavior/instinctive action in animals, that play an important role in attracting a compatible mate/opposite sex,\n  of the same species, for copulation/sexual reproduction\n(e)(ii) Courtship behavior in Animals:\n - Pairing;\n - territoriality;\n - Seasonal migration; \n - Smell/release of attractive sex hormones/odour;\n - Display of prominent colour patterns;\n - Mating calls/croaking/vocal display/sound signal;\n - Dancing/attractive movements;\n(f)Example of Organisms that carry out Holozoic mode of Nutrition:\n - Goat; rat; lizard; frog; bird; human; pitcher plants; sundew; bladderworths.\n(g) How Fingerprinting can be used in Crime Detection:\n - No two individuals have the identical pattern of fingerprints hence it is used for crime detection;\n - fingerprints left behind by a criminal at the scene of a crime or on weapon or any object associated with the crime\n   are  photographed then compared with the crime's suspect fingerprint if it matches then the suspect is the criminal                    "
