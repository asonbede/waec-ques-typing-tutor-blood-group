4    A pupil accidentally “watered” a potted plant with concentrated salt solution. After sometime the plant began to wilt. The wilting of the plant is due to the fact that # the plant tissue has been poísoned by the salt which is absorbed by the plant.# the salt solution causes faster rate of transpiration leading to the death ofthe plant cells. # the salt soluton has caused water to be lost from the plant cells leading to loss of turgor. # the root hairs die off and can no longer absorb water. #
