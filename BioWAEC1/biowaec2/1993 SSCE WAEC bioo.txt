59    Lamarck’s evolution theory could be summarised by the statement that # the changing environment imposes structural, physiological and behavioural changes in organisms. # species that are unable to adapt become extinct. # new characteristics do not arise in organisms in time of need. # in a changing and unstable environment nature rejects the weak. # only the fittest can survive in a challenging environment. #
60    The property of clay soil that prevents it from supporting thick vegetation is its # tendency of becoming water logged. # inability to retain much water. # porosity and low water retention ability. # high capillary spaces between the soil particles.# possession of chemically weathered granite rocks. #
