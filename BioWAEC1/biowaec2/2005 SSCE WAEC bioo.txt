4    A major difference between plants and animals is that # there is free movement in animals while this is limited in plants. # there is indefinite growth in animals only. # animals consume inorganic materials as food, while plants consume organic materials. # animals give up carbon-dioxide as a waste product of respiration while plants do not. #

12   Which of the following best explains why it is difficult to see clearly in dim light? # too little light reaches the retina and so the cones may not be stimulated at all. # the choroid reflect all the light that enters the eye. # dim light causes the pupil to close up so that not much light enters the eye. # initially the eyes cannot operate when the light is dim. #
13   In active transport, molecules move against a concentration gradient, therefore, # molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. # the concentration gradient has little effect on the movement of molecules. # molecules force their way through special channels. # molecules move from a region of low concentration to a region of high concentration. #
